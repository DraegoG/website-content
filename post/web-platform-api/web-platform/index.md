The Web Platform is an amazing ecosystem of APIs, tools, languages, and it is more powerful than ever today, in 2018.

I wrote a lot of tutorials and articles on this blog related to the Web Platform.

This post aims to organize them so you can find things more easily, and serve as a roadmap to learn how to develop on the Web Platform.

## Browser API guides

First dive into the DOM, the most fundamental API exposed by the browser. Then check out the other important API, explained in simple terms.

- [The DOM](/dom/)
- [The Selectors API](/selectors-api/)
- [The XHR API](/xhr/)
- [The Fetch API](/fetch-api/)
- [The Channel Messaging API](/channel-messaging-api/)
- [The Cache API](/cache-api/)
- [Service Workers](/service-workers/)
- [Progressive Web Apps](/progressive-web-apps/)
- [The History API](/history-api/)
- [The Push API](/push-api/)
- [The Notifications API](/notifications-api/)
- [The Console API](/console-api/)
- [CORS](/cors/)
- [Web Workers](/web-workers/)
- [requestAnimationFrame](/requestanimationframe/)
- [WebSockets](/websockets/)
- [WebRTC](/webrtc/)
- [The Speech Synthesis API](/speech-synthesis-api/)

## SVG, an amazing image format

## Storage APIs

The Web Platform provides 3 fundamental storage APIs: cookies, Web Storage and IndexedDB. Know their pros and cons:

- [IndexedDB](/indexeddb/)
- [Cookies](/cookies/)
- [Web Storage](/web-storage-api/)

## Developer Tools for the Web

We developers would be completely lost and terrified without the amazing Dev Tools provided in all the popular Browsers.

- [An Overview of the Browser DevTools](/browser-dev-tools/)
- [A list of Chrome DevTools tips and tricks](/chrome-devtools-tips/)

## Modern CSS

CSS has come a long way! Learn the new amazing things CSS can do today!

- [CSS Grid](/css-grid)
- [Flexbox](/flexbox/)
- [CSS Variables](/css-variables/)
- [PostCSS](/postcss/)
- [CSS Transitions](/css-transitions/)
- [CSS Animations](/css-animations/)

## What's next?

If you're ready to go ahead and dive into more advanced lands, check out

- [Learn JavaScript](/javascript/)
- [React](/react/)
- [Node.js](/nodejs/)

The best way to learn things is to build small things with each new technology. Sometimes it's just hard to decide what to do. I made a list of [sample web app ideas](/sample-app-ideas/), maybe one of those will be a quick start to learning something new today!
